# Underwater Minesweeper : Mine Classification Using SONAR Data

Machine Learning Course Submission

See full report [here:](https://github.com/mbdelaresma/rock_mine_classification/blob/main/FinalReport.ipynb)

# Highlights

1. Yeo-Johnson transformation was done on the dataset because most of the features are skewed.

2. There is a notable increase in accuracy after the features were scaled for kNN and SVC.

3. Grid search was used to optimize the hyperparameters of chosen machine learning models.

4. It is important to have a holdout data set to test the modelâ€™s performance after training and validation.

5. Depending on the problem, precision or recall is more important than the accuracy of the model.
